# 4.2 Null spaces, column spaces, row spaces, linear transforms

Now that we know what a space is, we should know common ways to use matrices to represent spaces.a

## Column space
For example, until now, we have typically assumed that columns of a matrix represent vectors. That is to say,
Given $A_{{mxn}} =[c_{1},\dots c_{n}]$
We would assume a space made up of $Span \{ c_{1},\dots c_{n} \}$.
The technical notation for this space is **Col A**

Here is an example. Describe the following in terms of $\mathbb{R}^n$
$$
\text{Col}A=\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$
The answer is $\mathbb{R}^2$ and this is just normal 2 space.

## Row Space
Row space is the same as column space, but with rows
Given $A_{{mxn}} =[r_{1},\dots r_{m}]$
Note how the last row vector $r_{m}$ has a subscript m, meaning that it is the m$th$ row.


---
## Null Space
The last space is obtained by solving the matrix.  Specifically, we need to find a set full of vectors:
$\{\vec{x}:A\vec{x}=\vec{0}\}$
In words, that means every $\vec{x}$ in the Nul A times the original matrix results in 0.

> [!NOTE]
> Thinking about linear transformations, Nul A refers to every vector that gets mapped to 0. 
> If we start with a Plane, then squish down to a line, there will be some line thru the origin that gets mapped to $\vec{v_{0}}$ and that is Nul A



Given a matrix $Amxn$, the null space $= \{   \vec{x} : A \vec{x} = \vec{0}\}$
$\text{Nul A}$
check: if $\vec{v}_{1} \wedge \vec{v}_{2} \in \text{Nul A}$
Then $A(\vec{v}_{1} + \vec{v}_{2}) = A\vec{v}_{1} + A\vec{v}_{2}=\vec{0} + \vec{0} = \vec{0}$


## Ex1
Find $\text{Nul A}$
$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
-3 & 6 & -1 & 1 & -7 \\
1  & -2  & 2 & 3 & -1 \\
2 & -4 & 5 & 8 & -4
\end{bmatrix}
$$
Swap $r_{2} \leftrightarrow r{3}$
$$
\sim \begin{bmatrix}
1  & -2  & 2 & 3 & -1 \\
-3 & 6 & -1 & 1 & -7 \\
2 & -4 & 5 & 8 & -4
\end{bmatrix}
$$
$r_{2}+3r_{1} \wedge_{3}r-2r_{1}$ 
$$
\sim \begin{bmatrix}
1  & -2  & 2 & 3 & -1 \\
0 & 0 & 5 & 10 & -10 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 2 & -2
\end{bmatrix}
$$
And we see that $5r_{3}=r_{2}$ Lets set the row with a leading $-5$ to 0 and move it to the bottom
$$
\sim \begin{bmatrix}
1  & -2  & 2 & 3 & -1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 2 & -2 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

And to get it to reduced echelon form, all the columns above the pivot must be 0. This just eliminates those variabes from the equations, leaving onnly free variables

$$
\sim \begin{bmatrix}
1  & -2  & 0 & -1 & 3 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 2 & -2 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix} 
$$

So now, to represent this space we make our $\vec{x}$
$$
\vec{x} = \begin{bmatrix}
-2x_{2}-x_{4}+3x_{5} \\
x_{4} -2x_{5} \\
x_{3} \\
x_{4}
\end{bmatrix} \sim
x_{2}\begin{bmatrix}
-2 \\ \\

0 \\
0 \\
0
\end{bmatrix}
$$
