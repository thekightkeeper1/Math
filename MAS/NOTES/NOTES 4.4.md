**Coordinate Systems**


> [!NOTE] Theorem 8 -- Definition of a basis
> Given a basis $\mathcal{B}=\{ \vec{b}_1, \dots , \vec{b_n} \}$ For vector space $V$. For every vector $v$ in $V$ there is a way to represent it as a linear combination. 
> E.g. **There are constants** $\vec{c}_1, \dots , \vec{c_n}$ **such that** $v = \vec{c}_1b_{1}, \dots , \vec{c_n}b_{n}$

So normally we represent vectors using the natural basis of $\vec{e}_1, \dots , \vec{e_n}$. And so representing $v$ is as simple as using putting its coordinates in a vertical matrix.
$$
v = (2,3) = \begin{bmatrix}
2 \\
3
\end{bmatrix}
$$

If we want to specify that it is in a different basis, then we would write:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
v
\end{bmatrix}_{\mathcal{B}} = \begin{bmatrix}
\dots
\end{bmatrix}
$$
And our basis would b
$$\mathbf{x}\mapsto\left[\,\mathbf{x}\,\right]_{B}\!$$
